A game I developed for Ludum Dare 26 compo, where you develop a video game in 48 hours. This was my first time using PyGame/SDL, my first time building a game since high school, and my first time really working with and interacting with 2D graphics.

It was a great experience. I kept a log in the "learning_game_programming_LD26.md" file.

The code is very, very, very messy at the moment - this is because I did the game in 48 hours and because this is my first significant game project. There's a bunch of dead code and just plain tons of disorganized stuff all over the place. When I take my time to program it really doesn't end up looking like this at all.
